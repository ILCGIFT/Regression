## Introduction

Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's widely applied in various fields such as economics, finance, machine learning, and more.

In this repository, we provide information, code, and examples related to different regression models to help you understand and apply regression analysis effectively.

## Linear Regression

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a basic form of regression analysis that establishes a linear relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X). It's suitable when you want to predict a continuous outcome based on a single predictor variable.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression extends the concept of simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables. It's used when you need to predict a continuous outcome based on two or more predictor variables.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression is an extension of linear regression that allows you to capture non-linear relationships between variables by introducing polynomial terms. It's useful when the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is curved.

## Ridge and Lasso Regression

Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques applied to linear regression models to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a regression model used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome and is widely used in machine learning for tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more.
